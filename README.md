This is the weather app i made as a major project for the virtual internship i did at Teachnook with collaboration with IIT Bhubaneswar.
This app gives us the real time weather of different locations that we need with the help of APIs.
Here the core include HTML,CSS,JS and usage of API(OpenWeatherMap API).
These are the concepts i learned and i put forward them to use to build my major project here.
